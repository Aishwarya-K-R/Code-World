Function Description
Complete the twoStacks function in the editor below.

twoStacks has the following parameters: - int maxSum: the maximum allowed sum
- int a[n]: the first stack
- int b[m]: the second stack

- int: the maximum number of selections Nick can make

Input Format

The first line contains an integer,  (the number of games). The  subsequent lines describe each game in the following format:

The first line contains three space-separated integers describing the respective values of  (the number of integers in stack ),  (the number of integers in stack ), and  (the number that the sum of the integers removed from the two stacks cannot exceed).
The second line contains  space-separated integers, the respective values of .
The third line contains  space-separated integers, the respective values of .

The image below depicts the integers Nick should choose to remove from the stacks. We print  as our answer, because that is the maximum number of integers that can be removed from the two stacks without the sum exceeding .
